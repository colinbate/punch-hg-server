			<h1>No repository configured or reachable</h1>
			<p>Welcome to your punch-hg-server site. Unfortunately during startup, we couldn't find your site. Sorry about that. There are usually two reasons for that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You don't have a repository identified in your <code>config.json</code> file</li>
				<li>We couldn't reach your configured repository. This could be for networking or authentication reasons.</li>
			</ol>
